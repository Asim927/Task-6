# Task-6
# Task 6: Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

## Objective
To build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset and evaluate its performance.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- California Housing Dataset from scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the California housing dataset
2. Converted data into a Pandas DataFrame
3. Performed data inspection using head(), info(), and describe()
4. Separated input features (X) and target variable (y)
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Linear Regression model
7. Predicted house prices on test data
8. Compared actual vs predicted prices
9. Evaluated model using MAE and RMSE
10. Plotted Actual vs Predicted values
11. Interpreted model coefficients

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Results
The Linear Regression model was able to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy. The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between actual and predicted values.

## Interview Questions Covered
- Use of Linear Regression
- Importance of RMSE
- Train-Test split purpose
- Meaning of coefficients
- Underfitting concept
